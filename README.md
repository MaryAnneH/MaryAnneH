- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MaryAnneH
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in continuing to develop my UI/UX porfolio. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently finishing up a Google UX cetification, expanding my creative toolkit/vocabulary to compliment my strong and seasoned Graphic Design skills.
- ðŸ“« Reach me through my website at: www.hanlondesign.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: My 3x-great-grandmother came to Chicago as a child in 1838. Would love to be a fly on the wall and see the city grow and expand through her eyes and all those that came between us.
